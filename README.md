Project: Website for BBQ Restaurant
Welcome to Chill&Grill, where the aroma of smoky barbecue and the ambiance of laid-back vibes combine to create an unforgettable dining experience. This website is a gateway to a world of mouthwatering delights, where every bite is a journey through the rich flavors of the grill. The website showcases our rich menu, along with all of the necessary information about the company Chill&Grill, and also, the website lets you contact us directly via built in contact forms.

The website was created with the usage of modern web technologies such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Stylesheets), and also Bootstrap. The design concept is centered around an old-like aesthetic, reflecting the warm and inviting atmosphere of our restaurant, and there is in addition imagery of mouthwatering barbecue dishes to entice visitors and convey the essence of our offerings.
